### Abstract 
This paper presents an approach that integrates statistical process control techniques with workflow
systems in order to achieve software process monitoring. Our approach allows: (i) software process
monitoring through the automated metrics collection; and (ii) the statistical process control of
software process aided transparently by statistical tools. The use of workflow systems to this
integration adds the benefits of statistical process control without the additional effort to
integrate and use statistical tools. Our proposal allows project managers to identify problems early
during the process execution, enabling quickly reactions (process improvements, training, etc.) to
reduce costs and ensure software quality.
