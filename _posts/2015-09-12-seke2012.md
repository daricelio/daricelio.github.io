### Abstract 
Distributed version control systems provide support for pull request strategy, which is used to register external contributions in collaborative software projects. The data present on a pull request can provide insights of factors that have influence on the acceptance or rejection of contributions in open source projects. Furthermore, the discovery of knowledge about pull requests allows confirming or denying existing hypotheses and helps software developers and project managers to guide their actions. This work proposes the use of data mining, more specifically, the extraction of association rules, to find patterns that exert influence on the acceptance (merge) of a pull request. The results suggest that: (i) the use of association rules allows to identify which factors increase the likelihood of a pull request merge; (ii) the identification of attributes that influence the merge reveals important knowledge about the pull request model; and (iii) with the use of association rules, it is possible to determine which factors contribute to a faster merge.
