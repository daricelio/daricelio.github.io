### Abstract 

This work presents a comparative study of the usage of compositional and annotational approaches in
the modularization of software process lines. In our comparative study, an Open-UP based software
process line extracted from three existing projects is modelled and implemented using the
compositional and annotative approaches with the main aim to address a systematic variability
management and automatic process derivation. The results show that the GenArch-P - annotative
approach - can bring many advantages to the modelling of software process lines considering our
comparison criteria
