### Abstract 

Context: There is an increasing need to perform controlled experiments in software engineering.

Objective: This systematic review (SR) shows the current state of the art on the tools and
infrastructures that provide automated support for controlled experiments in software engineering.

Method: We performed manual searches in journals and conferences proceedings for papers describing
supporting tools and environments to conduct controlled experiments. Results: We found and reviewed
25 primary studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 15 relevant studies.

Conclusion: There are few supporting environments for conducting controlled experiments, despite of
the increasing demand for this kind of study in software engineering. We also highlight many
limitations of these tools, which configures great potential for future research.
