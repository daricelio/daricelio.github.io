### Abstract 

Over the last years, software product line engineering has been applied and adopted by different
companies. Existing software product line approaches promote the development of a centralized
infrastructure of core assets that addresses the common features and provides variation points to
the integration of the variable features of the SPL. In the context of distributed development of
enterprise information systems, there are several scenarios where the adoption of these centralized
approaches is not enough to accommodate the several requests for the integration of new features and
maintenance of existing ones. In such scenarios, the SPL engineering team needs to fork the SPL core
assets in order to address the customer needs and due to the marked pressure. In this paper, we
propose a delta - oriented approach that promotes the reconciliation of software product lines that
are independently evolved. Our approach allows: (i) the automated detection of feature conflicts of
the SPLs independently evolved; and (ii) the resolution and merge of such feature conflicts.
