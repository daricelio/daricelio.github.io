### Abstract 

Abstract-Social coding environments such as GitHub and Bitbucket are changing
the way software is built. They are not only lowering the barriers for placing
changes, but also making open-source contributions more visible and traceable.
Not surprisingly, several mature, active, non-trivial open-source software
projects are switching their decades of software history to these environments.
There is a belief that these environments have the potential of attracting new
contributors to open-source projects. However, there is little empirical
evidence to support these claims. In this paper, we quantitatively and
qualitatively studied a curated set of open-source projects that made the move
to GitHub, aiming at understanding whether and how this migration fostered
collaboration. Our results suggest that although interaction in some projects
increased after migrating to GitHub, the rise of contributions is not
straightforward.
