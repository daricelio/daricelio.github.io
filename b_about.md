### Nice to meet you!   

Short bio
Leonardo Gresta Paulino Murta is an Associate Professor at the Computing Institute of Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF). He holds a Ph.D. (2006) and a M.S. (2002) degree in Systems Engineering and Computer Science from COPPE/UFRJ, and a B.S. (1999) degree in Informatics from IM/UFRJ. He has a productivity research grant level 2 from CNPq since 2009 and had a Young Scientist research grant from FAPERJ from 2012 to 2018. He has published over 150 papers in journals and conferences and received an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2006 and three best paper awards at SBES, in 2009, 2014, and 2016. He has served as program committee member of ICSE 2014, program chair of SBES 2015, program co-chair of ICSE NIER 2019, associate editor of JBCS since 2013 and JSERD since 2016, and editor in chief of JSERD since 2017. His research area is software engineering, and his current research interests include configuration management, software evolution, software architecture, and provenance. 

My  main  research  field  is  Empirical  Software  Engineering.  I  use  methodologies  such  as  machine learning,  statistics  and  qualitative  techniques  (e.g.,  surveys  and  interviews)  to  better  understand  the  software development  phenomena. The  goal  of  my  research  is  to  augment  the  body  of  knowledge  of the Software  Engineering  field and  ultimately  optimize  the  practice  of  software  development.  For  example,  what practices  suit  a  development  team  better?  A  shorter  releasing  cycle  with  several  sprints  or  a  longer  release cycle with minor releases along the way?  Despite  being  important (and sometimes risky) decisions, software  project  managers  have  limited  access to  a  body  of  scientific  knowledge  that  can help  them  take  important decisions.  My  research  aims  to  build  a solid  empirical  knowledge  of Software Engineering  to  help  practicians  take  informed  decisions.  With  an  increasing  corpus  of  empirical  knowledge (i.e.,  data)  about  software  engineering,  the  development  of  tools  to  aid  developers  building  software  naturally comes  as  another  focus  of  my  research.  For  example,  I  use  machine  learning  algorithms  to  learn  from  historical data  and  help  developers  to  identify  bottlenecks  within  the  development  process.

Besides research, I like bodybuilding, games, and, especially meeting new people. Feel free to send me an e-mail!
