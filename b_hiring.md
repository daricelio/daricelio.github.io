### Do you want to upgrade your academic career?

I am currently hiring new master's and Ph.D.  students to perform exciting
research in the Software Engineering field. The academic career is very
exciting as it allows you to use your own creativity to tackle real and
important problems. My supervision philosophy is to be committed with you and
bring the best of your potential. The academic career can be also rewarding as
you may travel around the world once you start publishing your research work! 

I am glad to supervise both kiwi (a.k.a new zealander) and international
students. If you are interested in starting a master's or Ph.D, please leave me
an e-mail.
